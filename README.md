# NovaForge Starter

NovaForge Starter is a structured, production-ready template for Flutter projects. It comes with a pragmatic layered architecture, reliable dependencies management, packages for logging, error reporting, analytics, database, built for projects where key architectural choices are already made.

## Template

This template is built on top of [sizzle_starter](https://github.com/hawkkiller/sizzle_starter) by Michael Lazebny
Unlike sizzle_starter, this version reflects a personal opinionated structure rather than a generalized starter.

Additionally, the template integrates several packages from the [PlugFox](https://plugfox.dev/packages/) ecosystem, which offer high-quality, modular tools tailored for production-level Flutter development.
